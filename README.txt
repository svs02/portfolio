<p><strong>Let me introduce myself!</strong> <br>
								I recently graduated from BCIT's Computer Information Technology.
								I always enjoy finding new things, learning them and challenging them. And I like to track problems and solve them through conversation with co-workers.
								Recently, I have been very interested in the DevOps Skill that I learned at school, so I am working on studying and personal projects.
								I'm looking forward to my start as a professional developer.
								My strengths are smooth business conversation and problem tracking ability.
